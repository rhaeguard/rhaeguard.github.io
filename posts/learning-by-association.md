I have a method/strategy that I use to remember things. It is called _associative learning_ which is when one stimulus can trigger another one. Like [the experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_conditioning) Ivan Pavlov performed where a dog was conditioned to associate food with sound.

My method is not necessarily conditioning oneself to remember things, but more about remembering things together. This method can be useful in long-term activities such as learning a new language. It can also be useful in everyday scenarios. Let's cover the latter first. Say you have an appointment tomorrow and you are expected to bring a set of documents. While it's possible to pick up these documents in the morning before heading out, it would be better to gather all of them and put them right next to things you will definitely take such as your wallet and car keys. It is unlikely that you will forget all these items at the same time. What happens here is that we physically _associate_ the documents with other important artifacts to increase the chance of recall.

Another way to use _associative learning_ is in language learning. It becomes easier if you already know more than one language, but say you only know English and want to learn French. French and English share a lot of words, though they might have different meanings. Usually these meanings are not too far off. Anyway, say you see the word **mur** which means **wall**. You can memorize it, for sure, a better way would be to remember it with the word **mural** in English which is an artwork painted directly on a _wall_. A couple more examples:
- you might know **arboreal** has something to do with trees; well, **arbre** is a tree in French
- **infirmary** is a place where the sick receive treatment; **infirmier**/**infirmi√®re** is a nurse.
- you may know that **jaundice** is associated with the color **yellow**; well **jaune** is the word for **yellow** in French.

In the language learning context, watch out for [false friends](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_friend) which are phrases/words that are similar in spelling but have different meanings across different languages. One of the funniest ones being the word **gift** in German (poison) vs English (present).
